                        Developing Bookmark Me presented a unique challenge for its rich desktop-like graphical user interface. It is supported on all types of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The same operation can be performed in different ways depending on the device that Bookmark Me is running on. For example, to select folders in the desktop version, a user can use the mouse to drag a selection box around the folders. On mobile devices, where there is no mouse, the user can tap and hold a folder until it is marked as selected, and then select all other folders by tapping on them.

                        A unique MVVM library, written in TypeScript, called Light Observable UI was developed specifically for Bookmark Me in order to address the unique challenges that it presented.

                Light Observable UI is a lightweight MVVM library, written in TypeScript, that eases the development of modern single page applications with TypeScript and HTML. It has declarative bindings to automatically sync the UI with the model. It supports templating with JSX, which makes binding between view and a view model a breeze. It was created specifically for the development of Bookmark Me, and has been open sourced ever since for everyone to use.

                        We enjoyed developing Light Observable UI a lot. It presented an opportunity to solve complex challenges using leading industry practices. The Declarative Binding was made possible using the observable design pattern. The JSX templating was made possible by writing our own JSX Factory. It also has a Messaging Center that handles events between components that have no knowledge of each other, thus decreasing coupling. The Messaging Center uses a design pattern known as publish-subscribe.

                Dazzle is a cross-platform mobile music player application. It has a simple yet elegant design. It allows the user to play their favorite music on their device. It works in the foreground, as well as in the background, so the user can continue using their device, while they listen to music. It supports all the modern file types: mp3, mp4, flac, wav etc. It comes with a build-in Light and Dark Theme. We believe in simplicity, and Dazzle follows this principle. It comes with only the strictly necessary features and no additional bloatware.

                        We know how important it is to get a product early on. With Dazzle we had to find the perfect balance between UI and UX design, number of features, and technology stack, to develop it in the shortest timeframe possible, and get it out there in Google Play. We developed it using Test Driven Development with rich set of tests. The result? We haven't had a single crash since we've published it!

                Flashlight Lite is a tiny flashlight Android application. It does exactly what it sounds like: it turns the flashlight on or off. Not only that, it even allows the user to turn the flashlight on or off by shaking their phone, without even looking at the screen. It has a 5 star rating in Google Play. It seems our users find it just as awesome as we do!

                        Developing Flashlight Lite required from us to venture into territories we've never been before. We've never developed anything in Java before. We took the challenge and delivered successfully a great application. It is a testament that we can work outside of the comfort zone, and get the job done!

                Healthics - Prototype is a prototype that we developed for a client, based on their own design. The client needed a proof of concept to showcase to the EIC Accelerator to gain access to it, and compete for funding with other startups. Not only that. They only had 10 days before the competition. We rolled our sleeves up and set to work. The prototype was developed and delivered to the client, on their own servers, in 7 days. This gave enough time to the client to prepare. They presented it to the EIC Accelerator, and gained access to it thanks to the prototype we developed. We are always happy to help our clients. These kind of success stories is what motivates us!

                        The client was under tight schedule to get their product on time before a competition. We had to create a plan of development and make sure we will fit in the schedule. We estimated and prioritized all the features that we had to develop, and we developed them in order of importance. We delivered it in almost half of the agreed time. The client reviewed it and was really pleased with our work.

                        The main challenge here was to come with a beautiful design, that doesn't reduce the usability of the ASCII Table. The ASCII Table Pro is a great example that form and function can go along hand in hand.

                URL2QR is an extension for Google Chrome. It creates a QR code of the currently opened tab.

The idea for the extension belongs to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikola-angelov-a-35a7a7128/">Nikola Ananiev</a>. His idea was far ahead of it's time. In fact it was so good that Google decided to integrate the QR code generation right into Chrome!
